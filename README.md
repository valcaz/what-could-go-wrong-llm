# What Could Go Wrong - Online Communities Edition

This repository is the home for the resources needed for the « What « Could Go Wrong - Online Community version » online game. Originally crafted by Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju, the game debuted at the AutoUI 2020 Workshop. It underwent transformations under Nik and his collective at CMU, evolving to encompass AI-centric scenarios. The current iteration diverges significantly, shedding light on the dynamics of online communities.

In this version, the game delves into the vast universe of online social structures, leveraging prompts that explore the intricacies of virtual interactions and community governance. Inspiration for scenarios comes from a blend of theoretical research and real-world examples, including findings from Smith et al. (2024) and insights from VirtualSocietyHub.com. The framework for discussing potential social and ethical implications is informed by the Digital Society Ethics Code (Diaz & Patel, 2023) and principles of online community management (Jensen & Harper, 2022).

This iteration is enriched with a versatile LaTeX template, enabling enthusiasts to bring the game into the physical realm from its digital origins. Players can immerse themselves in "Community Constellations" through PlayingCards.io, where the game thrives with options for customizing decks through provided csv files for prompts and responses, allowing for a tailored exploration of online communities' complexities.

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

## Abstract
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsides to these systems. In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars in hopes of surfacing challenges that should be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur these conversations through a review of participant position statements and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called “What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving safety, increasing mobility, reducing emissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the AutoUI community more broadly can design well-considered solutions.

## Game Setup Instructions
1. Download this repository
2. Go to https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck to start a custom deck
3. Enter the virtual card table
4. Click the `Edit Table` icon in the green toolbard
5. Select `Room Options`
6. Select  `Import From File`
7. Upload `what-could-go-worng-av.pcio`
8. Click `Edit Table` to exit editing mode and go into gameplay mode

## Gameplay Instructions
1. All players draw 5 white cards from their stack 
2. Click the spinner to choose the first player who will be the Card Czar.
3. The Card Czar then pull a black prompt card and reads it to the group 
4. All other players then put 1 white response card face down in their slot.
5. The Card Czar then flips and reads each white card out loud.
6. The Card Czar then picks one of the white cards to further discuss. +1 point goes to the player whose card was chosen.
7. The group then discusses further what else could go wrong based on the chosen card. People can award +1 point anyone who makes a good point in discussion.
8. After the discussion dissipates after a few minutes, the next player becomes the Card Czar and clicks the “Deal” button. Each player then draws a new white card, so that they again have 5 cards in their hand.

### During the game
1. Take notes on ideas that you have not thought about before
2. Some of the cards are causes, others are effects. Don’t worry about what the game designers intended with each card, go where the discussion is best.
3. Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
4. It’s fine to take time to have discussion.
5. Try not to get side tracked, though!
