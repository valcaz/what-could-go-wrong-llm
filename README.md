# What Could Go Wrong - LLM Edition

This repository hosts the files used for the What Could Go Wrong? digital card game. Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju developed and presented the game at a Workshop at AutoUI 2020. The game was then modified by Nik and his team at CMU to be more generalized for AI-based systems.

The version here presents a further iteration on the game. In this iteration, prompts focus on applications of large language models. Example applications are drawn from two sources: Kaddour et al.(2023) and FlowGPT.com. The list of potential ethical issues stems from the AI4People framework (Floridi et al., 2021) and a business ethics enumeration (Baker and Comer, 2012). Besides, this iteration of the game includes a LaTeX template, which can be used to convert the digital card game into a physical card game. 

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

## Abstract
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsides to these systems. In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars in hopes of surfacing challenges that should be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur these conversations through a review of participant position statements and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called “What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving safety, increasing mobility, reducing emissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the AutoUI community more broadly can design well-considered solutions.

## Game Setup Instructions
1. Download this repository
2. Go to https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck to start a custom deck
3. Enter the virtual card table
4. Click the `Edit Table` icon in the green toolbard
5. Select `Room Options`
6. Select  `Import From File`
7. Upload `what-could-go-worng-av.pcio`
8. Click `Edit Table` to exit editing mode and go into gameplay mode

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Players draw 5 white cards.
2. Use the spinner to select the Card Czar.
3. The Card Czar draws a black prompt card and reads it aloud.
4. Players place a white response card face down.
5. The Card Czar reads each response aloud.
6. Instead of selecting the preferred answer, the Card Czar tries to guess who played which card, adding a playful and engaging twist. This rule encourages the Card Czar to justify their choices, enhancing memory and engagement with the game's content.
7. Discussion ensues, and points are awarded not only for the selected card but for insightful contributions to the conversation.
8. The role of Card Czar rotates, and play continues.

### During the game
1. Take notes on ideas that you have not thought about before
2. Some of the cards are causes, others are effects. Don’t worry about what the game designers intended with each card, go where the discussion is best.
3. Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
4. Engage in discussions, even on challenging topics.
5. Stay on track but allow for meaningful digressions.
